## Packages

We need the following packages:

```{r}
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(car)
library(irr)
```

## Data

Let's load and clean a bit the data:

```{r}
data <- "PathogenData130619.csv" %>% 
  read.csv() %>% 
  mutate_at(c("Prostration", "Respiratory", "Diarrhea", "CNS", "Joints", "Anemia"), `>`, 0) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(ends_with("FINAL")), `>`, 0) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(ends_with("y.n")), `>`, 0)
```

## Colinearities, confounding and summary table

A key issue in multivariate analyses is when the $x$ variables are not independent
(or colinear), which may cause confounding effects in your analysis, meaning that
some effect that you detect between $y$ and $x$  may not reflect a true direct
association between $y$ and $x$ but instead reflects the fact that both $x$ and
$y$ are associated to a third variable. In such conditions, we thus need to find
a way to correct for these potential confounding effects due to colinearities.
One powerful option is the so-called Type-II partial tests (see 
[here](https://mcfromnz.wordpress.com/2011/03/02/anova-type-iiiiii-ss-explained/)
for example). The `car` R package has the function `Anova()` that computes Type-II
partial tests for many classical models, including the logistic regression that
you want to use here. The function below uses the `car::Anova()` function to
compute significativity tests and summarises the results a multivariate
logistic regression in a table that contains estimates of Odds Ratio, their
confidence interval and their level of significativity, corrected for the 
potential confounding effect due to the other $x$ variables.

```{r}
make_table <- function(model) {
  out <- cbind(exp(cbind(coef(model), confint(model))),
               rbind(rep(NA, 2), as.data.frame(car::Anova(model))))
  names(out)[1] <- "Estimate"
  out
}
```

Let's try it on a simple multivariate analysis:

```{r}
model1 <- glm(AVI.FINAL ~ Prostration + Respiratory + Diarrhea + CNS + Joints + Anemia, binomial, data)
```

The results of which are:

```{r}
make_table(model1)
```

## An exhaustive search

We aim to explain the presence of these 8 pathogens:

```{r}
(xs <- paste0(c("AVI", "ORT", "PM", "MG", "IBV", "IBD", "FLU", "E.COLI"), ".FINAL"))
```

Note that we have to drop `ND.FINAL` that is never present in the data set:

```{r}
tmp <- data %>%
  select(ends_with("FINAL")) %>% 
  sapply(table)
tmp %>%
  reduce(bind_rows) %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  `rownames<-`(names(tmp))
```

Below is the list of co-variables that we will consider in order to explain the
presence of each of the above pathogens:

```{r}
ys <- c("Prostration", "Respiratory", "Diarrhea", "CNS", "Joints", "Anemia",
        "Age.weeks.", "Helminth.Y.N", "Nematodes.y.n", "Cestodes.Y.N")
```

Let's explore the agreements between the boolean variables in `ys` (i.e. all
except `Age.weeks.`). For that, the following function computes a matrix of
Cohen's kappa p values:

```{r}
kappa_mat <- function(df) {
  nb <- ncol(df)
  vn <- names(df)
  expand.grid(1:nb, 1:nb) %>% 
    t() %>% 
    as.data.frame() %>% 
    sapply(function(x) irr::kappa2(data.frame(df[, x[1]], df[, x[2]]))$p) %>% 
    matrix(nb) %>% 
    round(2) %>% 
    as.data.frame(vn) %>% 
    setNames(vn) %>% 
    `rownames<-`(vn)
}
```

Let's run it:

```{r}
data %>%
  select(ys, -Age.weeks.) %>% 
  kappa_mat()
```

Anemia appears pretty associated with CNS, and the presence of worms and CNS
appears associated with the presence of joints pain and cestodes. So, it's not
all super associated but there are some associations. Let's now look at how these
variables are associated with age:

```{r}
data %>%
  select(ys, -Age.weeks.) %>% 
  sapply(function(y)anova(glm(y ~ data$Age.weeks., binomial), test = "LRT")$P[2])
```

Only Diarrhea seems to decrease with age:

```{r}
summary(glm(Diarrhea ~ Age.weeks., binomial, data))
```

Let's now run the multivariate logisitc models corrected for confounding effects
in order to explain the presence of all the pathogens. Because there is not much
data and there is multiple infections in most of the cases, we'll also include
the presence of the other pathogens in the co-variables of the multivariable
logistic regression:

```{r}
for(i in seq_along(xs)) {
  print(xs[i])
  print(make_table(glm(formula(paste(xs[i], "~", paste(c(xs[-i], ys), collapse = " + "))), binomial, data)))
  cat("------------------------------------------------------------------\n")
}
```

It shows that

* the presences of AVI and ORT increase with age,
* CNS is positively associated to the presence of MG,
* Prostration is positively associated to the presence of $E. coli$.

Of note: this confounder effect correction is to unraveal "biological"
relationships between in order to understand how things works. But that doesn't
have much of practical benefit in a particular situation. If instead you aim at
predicting the etiology (or simply the presence of a pathogen), then rerun the
above model, without including the pathogens in the $x$ variables:

```{r}
for(i in seq_along(xs)) {
  print(xs[i])
  print(make_table(glm(formula(paste(xs[i], "~", paste(ys, collapse = " + "))), binomial, data)))
  cat("------------------------------------------------------------------\n")
}
```

## New model

New data:

```{r}
data2 <- "summary data.csv" %>% 
  read.csv() %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(ends_with("FINAL")), `>`, 0)
```

```{r}
mod1 <- glm(ORT.FINAL ~ Age.weeks. + Nochicks + Proportion.of.morbidity..per.100. + Cumulative.mortality + Days.onset + Ratio.of.weight.standard.weight, binomial, data2)
make_table(mod1)
```

```{r}
mod2 <- glm(ORT.FINAL ~ log(Age.weeks.) + log(Nochicks) + log(Proportion.of.morbidity..per.100.) + log(Cumulative.mortality + 1) + log(Days.onset) + log(Ratio.of.weight.standard.weight), binomial, data2)
make_table(mod2)
```

```{r}
mod3 <- glm(ORT.FINAL ~ Age.weeks. + log(Nochicks) + Proportion.of.morbidity..per.100. + log(Cumulative.mortality + 1) + log(Days.onset) + Ratio.of.weight.standard.weight, binomial, data2)
make_table(mod3)
```
