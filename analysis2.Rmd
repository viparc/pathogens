model 1: risk factor for infections univariate

model 2: prediction
prediction of the etiology based on symptoms
resp, diarrhea, cns, anemia, foot lesions : 5 symptoms
also 3 variables: time since onset, mortality, morbidity

Hi Marc,
As we discussed, I would like to send you data for Modelling.
It includes 2 sheets with variables of 2 models:
1.       Risk factor Analysis(6 variables):
a.       Age
b.      Size of flock
c.       Other chicken flock
d.      Farmer experience (years)
e.      Ratio weight/ normal weight
f.        Helminth (Yes/No)
2.       Patterns to predict disease (8 variables):
a.       Respiratory
b.      Diarrhea
c.       Anemia
d.      CNS
e.      Joint/Foot problems
f.        Mortality
g.       Morbidity
h.      Days since onset
Let me know if anything is not too clear. Thanks a lot for your support!
Best regards,
VÃ¢n

## Packages

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

## Risk factor analysis

Reading the first tab of the excel file and putting in shape:

```{r}
rfa <- readxl::read_excel("DataforMarc.xlsx", "Risk Factors analysis") %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(OthChickFlock, `Helminth Y/N`, ends_with("FINAL")), ~ . > 0) %>% 
  select(-Farmcode)
```

Let's perform nivariable analyses with logistic regressions. It's important to
note that these models are only for prediction, in the specific context of the
chicken farms of this study, not for explanation. The following function
returns the effect of variable`x` on variable `y`

```{r}
x_effect <- function(x, y) {
  paste0("`", y, "`~`", x, "`") %>% 
    formula() %>% 
    glm(binomial, rfa) %>% 
    summary() %>% 
    coef() %>% 
    data.frame() %>% 
    `[`(-1, ) %>% 
    data.frame("risk_factor" = rownames(.), ., stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
}
```

Let's use this function for all `x` and `y` variables:

```{r}
for (y in grep("FINAL", names(rfa), value = TRUE)) {
  print(y)
  print(bind_rows(lapply(grep("FINAL", names(rfa), value = TRUE, invert = TRUE), x_effect, y)))
}
```

Interpretation:

* the risks of AVI, ORT and FLU infection increase with age;
* the presence of helminths decreases the risk of GUM;

Note however that if we had to correct for multiple tests (54), a
significativity threshold of 0.05 would become 0.00093 and none of these tests
would be significant.

```{r include = F, eval = F}
efs <- readxl::read_excel("DataforMarc.xlsx", "Patterns to predict disease") %>% 
  select(-Farmcode) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(-matches("^Cu|^Pr")), ~ . > 0)
```
